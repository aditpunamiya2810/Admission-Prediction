# Admission-Prediction
The model takes inputs in various fields and gives a prediction of chance of admission in a college using a minimal UI which was made by StreamLit

The model was uses Multi-Linear Regression to predict the chance of prediciton and the model as well as the parametrs are saved using the pickle library.
They are saved in a binary file and then used in the streamlit app, a webapp with minimal UI made using stramlit. When the new data is given, it predicts the chace of admission.
Streamlit makes the app responsive, hence no additional coding is not required!
